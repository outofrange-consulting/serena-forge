description: Read and navigate C# code in the CURRENT repo through Serena's symbolic read tools (get_symbols_overview, find_symbol, find_referencing_symbols, search_for_pattern) instead of reading whole files. Fetches exact symbol bodies, callers, and references on demand.
when_to_use: "Trigger when the user says \"read this class\", \"find the symbol\", \"who calls\", \"navigate the code\", or otherwise wants to inspect a specific type/method, its body, or its callers in the current repository."

## Purpose

Read C# by **symbol**, not by whole file. Serena's Roslyn-backed language server
lets you pull a class outline, a single method body, or every caller of a symbol
without loading an entire `.cs` file into context. This keeps context lean and
answers precise.

This skill covers **reading and navigation only**. It does not edit code —
that is `serena-refactor`.

## The read workflow

Do NOT open a `.cs` file with the native Read tool by reflex. Instead:

1. **Outline first.** Call `get_symbols_overview` on the target file to get its
   top-level symbols (namespaces, classes, methods, signatures) — a cheap map of
   the file without its full contents.
2. **Fetch one body.** Call `find_symbol` with the symbol's name/path to pull
   just that symbol's source. Request children (e.g. a class's methods) only when
   you need them. This replaces reading the whole file.
3. **Find callers.** Call `find_referencing_symbols` on a symbol to list every
   place that references it — the reliable "who calls this" answer, resolved by
   the LSP rather than by grep guessing.
4. **Regex fallback.** Call `search_for_pattern` when you need a textual/regex
   match (a string literal, an attribute, a TODO) that isn't a named symbol
   lookup.

### Verified Serena read tools

Use only these names:

- `get_symbols_overview` — top-level symbol outline of a file (start here).
- `find_symbol` — fetch a symbol (class/method/property) body by name or path;
  can include children and depth.
- `find_referencing_symbols` — all references/callers of a symbol ("who calls").
- `find_declaration` — jump to where a symbol is declared.
- `find_implementations` — implementations of an interface or abstract member.
- `search_for_pattern` — regex/text search across the repo.
- `list_dir` — list a directory within the project.
- `find_file` — locate a file by name/pattern.
- `read_file` — read a file (or line range) when a full read is genuinely needed;
  prefer the symbol tools above.
- `get_diagnostics_for_file` / `get_diagnostics_for_symbol` — compiler
  diagnostics for a file or a specific symbol.

## Typical requests

- **"Read this class `OrderService`"** → `find_symbol` on `OrderService`
  (with children if you need the methods), not a whole-file Read. Preview with
  `get_symbols_overview` first if you're unsure of the file's shape.
- **"Find the symbol `TenantResolver`"** → `find_symbol` by name; if ambiguous,
  `get_symbols_overview` on the candidate file, or `find_declaration`.
- **"Who calls `InvokeWithRequestContextAsync`"** →
  `find_referencing_symbols` on that method.
- **"Navigate the code" / "what's in this file"** → `get_symbols_overview` to
  get the outline, then `find_symbol` on whatever the user drills into.
- **"Where is this string / attribute used"** → `search_for_pattern` with the
  regex.

## Notes and prerequisites

- **This repo only.** Serena's tools resolve against the currently activated
  project. If the project isn't active, it must be activated (see
  `serena-forge-setup`).
- **.NET 10 only.** The Roslyn backend requires .NET 10+; on .NET 9 projects the
  language server times out. If symbol lookups fail on a .NET 9 solution, stop
  and tell the user rather than fighting the LSP.
- **First-use warm-up.** On a large brownfield solution the language server may
  take up to ~30s to finish initializing before symbol results are reliable. If a
  lookup returns nothing immediately after activation, retry once after it
  settles rather than concluding the symbol is absent.
- **Reading `.cs` is still allowed — but whole-file reads are nudged.** serena-forge
  blocks *writes* to `.cs`, not reads. However, a native whole-file `Read` of a
  `.cs` file over ~100 lines triggers a one-click confirmation (`prefer_symbolic_read.py`)
  steering you to `get_symbols_overview` → `find_symbol` (`include_body: true`) on
  just the target. A bounded `Read` (with `limit`) and files under the threshold
  pass through silently. Reach for the symbol tools first so you pull the minimum
  needed; the threshold is tunable via `SERENA_FORGE_READ_MAXLINES` (0 disables it).
